## Manifesto 

### Mission 

I want people to get a good level of financial litteracy and understand the value of having the capacity to create currency in our society, so they can foresee a future living in diverse autonomous and resilient communities and have the conviction they can build it by themselves with the proper tools without having to be a Tech or Economics well versed group. 

### Vision
I see the society leveraging the best features of Local Currencies and Web3 technologies (Web, Blockchain, AI) to foster collective collaboration in new fast growing and sustainable economies without the need of direct intervention from superior public or private third party, as well as reinforcing understanding of global problems and social cohesion through the Metaverse. 

### If I had unlimited ressources

By having unlimited ressources, I'd guide the creation of thousands of communitites with an emergent yet evolving DAO protocol, helping them to reach maturity in exchanging services / products / infrastructure and automating the creation of synergies between complimentary communities. 


### If I had the backing of a community 

With the backing of a community, I'll start to test my protocol with three first communities of different kinds: volunteering, local stores loyalty programs with a decentralized voucher/(local currency) trade marketplace, co-property landlords association, to see how they evolve and create policies / currency management according to their own needs

Once mature this communities mature, I'd extend the experience to public and private organizations willing to experiment with notions like participative budget and those needing insights about the strenghts and needs of targeted communities regarding wise investments and informed marketing campaigns, having in mind proper strategies to respect the protection of local culture / value and the development of human / sustainable values in the service / product exchange chain;

Finally I'd create a federation of mature DAO LLC communities to share best practices and local economics models with the help of AI automation, so they can either become official local banks or be able to provide a complete ecosysteme of services, products and infrastructure needed for sustainable human development, like cells living in symbiosis at different levels and aspects without the complexity of a multilayer hierarchical structure.


## Goals 

### Milestone 1

Have a prototype and three different pilot communities to test on a low or null fee blockchain/Web3");

### Milestone2

Have a full product (voting, services management, data aggregation) for promoting investment insights and three different mature communities to use as reference for newer communities");

### Milestone 3 

Have extended features (NFT content rewards, social media / gaming partners to reflect the activity of each community on the metaverse) for promoting social cohesion / motivation to participate within financially autonomous communities and 50 new different community types to use as candidates for synergies");

### Milestone 4 

Have extended management tools (automated and legally compliant accountability for local currency management, AI to detect synergies and export economic model) for growth acceleration of candidate mature communities for federative synergy structure / global currency and the recognition of public insitutions for them to operate and expand operations to infrastructure and banking capabilities"
